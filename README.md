[00:13.87] Seven days has gone so fast
[00:17.05] I really thought the pain would pass
[00:20.20] It's been nearly an hour
[00:21.83] Since I thought of you
[00:32.83] 
[00:26.74] But your not answering the phone
[00:29.96] I'd settle for a busy tone
[00:32.59] At least but that I'd know that you're okay
[00:39.78] A girl like you ain't meant to go away, oh
[01:00.78] 
[00:45.60] Now you're gone
[00:48.69] And nothing else I want
[00:51.96] And now that it's over
[00:55.14] There's nothing else I want
[00:58.39] And what have I done
[01:01.69] It looks like I was wrong
[01:05.73] Is everything really meant to change?
[01:12.30] I guess we're like water and a flame
[01:16.36] Water and a flame
[01:24.86] 
[01:18.60] I'm tired of this empty house
[01:21.87] I need a drink to get me out
[01:25.19] A couple more 'til I forget your name
[01:43.69] 
[01:31.54] I saw a boy that looked like you
[01:34.80] I didn't know quite what to do
[01:38.01] It took a power of will to break my stare
[01:43.89] I realized what I wanted wasn't there
[02:02.39] 
[01:50.31] Now you're gone
[01:53.42] There's nothing else I want
[01:56.70] Now that it's over
[01:59.93] There's nothing else I want
[02:03.15] What have I done
[02:06.40] Looks like I was wrong
[02:10.42] Is everything really meant to change?
[02:17.02] I guess we're like water and a flame
[02:21.25] Water and a flame
[02:29.75] 
[02:24.12] If you see me coming
[02:25.56] I look away, I look away
[02:30.41] And if your mind is made up
[02:32.19] I look away, I will look away
[02:46.69] 
[02:37.05] If you're worried 'bout it
[02:38.48] I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
[02:43.39] And all this sorrow and this pain
[02:46.05] Is gonna away
[02:52.55] 
[03:01.74] Now you're gone
[03:04.84] And nothing else I want
[03:08.14] Now that it's over
[03:11.24] There's nothing else I want
[03:14.78] What have I done?
[03:17.84] Looks like I was wrong
[03:21.81] Is everything really meant to change?
[03:28.37] I guess we're like water and a flame
[03:32.52] Water and a flame
